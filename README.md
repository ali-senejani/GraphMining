# <Center> A Simple Application of Graph Theory On Crime Data 

This work attempts to illustrate a practical and simple application of several graph theory metrics on crime data that are relevant to a bipartite unweighted network. The aim is to help uncover insightful information based on relationships between a crime vertex and people associated with that crime. The graph algorithms used below are implemented by the [**NetworkX**](https://networkx.org/) Python library.

The data files are stored in the *data* directory.

The notebook, *Networkx_crime.ipynb*,  containing the analysis and code is structured as follows:
1. Description of the data and properties of the graph network
2. Data preprocessing
3. Visual representation of data as a graph
4. Analysis of relevant graph theory algorithms:
  - Degree centraility
  - Link Analysis
    - HITS
    - Page rank
  - Betweenness centraility
  - Closeness centraility 
  - Similarity measures
    - Predecessors
    - Successors 

5. Plotting the distribution of crime
6. Conclusion
7. Sources
